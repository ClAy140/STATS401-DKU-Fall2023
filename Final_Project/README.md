# Final Project: Analyzing the Gacha System in Genshin Impact

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Gacha** system in *Genshin Impact*, a popular action role-playing game developed by miHoYo. The **Gacha** system is a lottery-based mechanic where players use in-game or real-world currency to obtain characters and weapons. Our objective is to:
- **Evaluate the actual probability of obtaining characters and weapons** compared to the official rates provided by miHoYo.
- **Analyze player spending behavior and recharge trends** in the game.
- **Examine team composition data** to understand popular and effective character synergies.
- **Develop an interactive dashboard** that presents these insights visually.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**  
   - We used a **crowd-sourced dataset** from GitHub containing **15.59 million Gacha pulls**.
   - Extracted **team composition data** from external sources to analyze **character pairings and synergies**.
   - Retrieved **real-time Gacha history** from **miHoYo's Official Web API**.

2. **Data Processing**
   - Data was **cleaned, filtered, and analyzed** using **Python**.
   - Outliers and inconsistencies were addressed to improve accuracy.
   - The dataset was structured to allow meaningful comparisons and trends.

3. **Visualization Development**
   - Built **interactive visualizations** using **D3.js** and **React.js**.
   - Designed a user-friendly **dashboard** for real-time insights.
   - Implemented various visualization techniques, including **bar charts, network graphs, and time-series charts**.

## Results
We developed five key visualizations to explore player behavior and Gacha mechanics:

1. **Gacha Probability Analysis**  
   - Displays the **average number of pulls required to obtain a 5-star character**.
   - Uses a **scatter plot** to show distribution trends and outliers.
   - Helps players estimate their chances of obtaining high-tier characters.

2. **Recharge Trends Over Time**  
   - Uses a **time river chart** to visualize recharge behavior across different banners (Novice, Permanent, Character, Weapon).
   - Provides insights into **spending patterns and player investment** in the game.

3. **Character Availability Trends**  
   - A **dynamic horizontal bar chart** that shows the **total count of characters** pulled over time.
   - Animations allow users to see changes in character availability.

4. **Gacha History Breakdown**  
   - Allows users to analyze **past Gacha pulls** and understand banner-specific success rates.
   - Includes **interactive filtering** to switch between banners and inspect individual pulls.

5. **Team Composition Analysis**  
   - A **network graph** that visualizes the **most frequently used character teams**.
   - The size of each character node represents its **usage frequency**.
   - Clicking on nodes reveals **team synergy information**.

## Discussion
- Our findings indicate that **most players obtain 5-star characters within the expected range**, but luck can vary significantly.
- Spending behaviors fluctuate depending on **new character releases** and **limited-time banners**.
- The analysis of team compositions helps players **optimize their strategies** by identifying **popular and effective character synergies**.

## Conclusion
This project provides a **comprehensive analysis** of Genshin Impactâ€™s Gacha system, offering valuable insights into player behavior, spending trends, and character usage. By combining **big data analytics, visualization techniques, and real-time data collection**, we enable players to make **informed decisions** about their Gacha pulls.
